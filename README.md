# Managing-clutter-A-cakewalk

I had a folder containing files of multiple types like `txt`, `mp3` etc. Hence, I decided to clean up this mess and organize them in a way that images are in one folder and songs in another. I was moving them when it struck me that it could be automated by writing this python script which can automatically create a separate directory and move files in their respective destinations.  

Please note that you need to [setup Python 2][1] on your system.  
The script makes use of the module named [`os`][2] which allows us to use OS-specific functionalities.  
Visit [my blog article about this script][3] for more information.
