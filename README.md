I had a folder in my system in which files of multiple types were there (.txt , .mp3). That was much of the mess and thus I decided to organize them in a way that images are in one folder and songs in one. I started moving them but there it struck me writing this python script which can automatically create a separate directory/folder and move files in their respective destinations.
(As moving a large number of individual files is such a tedious job)

Please note that you need to setup Python on your system before all this can be done. For that, follow these steps:

1.) Download the Python from here; https://www.python.org/downloads/
(I'll prefer 2.7 as it's a stable build)

2.) Install it. Go to C:( where windows reside and Get the path to your pythn folder (It'll be something like C:\Python27)

3.) Go to My computer (or This pc), go to advanced system settings, search for a variabe path there and click on edit.

4.) A box will appear with path, scroll the cursor to the already existing path till the end and add ;C:\Python27 (i.e. ; and then the path to your python folder in C drive). 
5.) Click Save or OK. Create a folder with name Pyprog(or anything else) in your C:\, here we'll be storing all our python programs, open cmd and type cd C:\Pyprog and then for running a file called first.py (same every python program with an axtension .py), run python first.py.

Here we have run our first python program. 

The screenshots in accordance with the initial situation and the one after running the script are provided. Save the code with extension .py and simply run like any other python program.
